# ffmpeg-runner

ffmpeg-runner is a Python-based command-line tool that simplifies the execution of FFMpeg commands by providing a YAML-based configuration file and a template-based syntax for specifying input and output files.

## Usage

By using this tool, you can package an executable program that can execute FFMpeg commands.

You can run it using the .exe file, or start it using start.bat or start.vbs, and stop it using stop.bat or stop.vbs.
